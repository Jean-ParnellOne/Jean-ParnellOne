## Jean Parnell Louis | Biomolecular Sciences & Computer Science

Hello, my name is JP Louis, and I am a sophomore at the Tandon School of Engineering, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Biomolecular Sciences. 

I hope to leverage my interests in both computer science and medicine to uncover new insights about both of these fields. Research topics such as Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, bioinformatics, computational neuroscience, and genomics are topics that greatly excite me; however, I am open to exploring new areas and welcome any opportunities to enrich my scientific understanding. 

Currently, I am participating in the Break Through Tech AI program through Cornell Tech, which focuses on training students in data science and machine learning topics. With that being said, please feel free to look at my projects and experiences. I look forward to meeting with like-minded computer science students, professors, and industry professionals.
